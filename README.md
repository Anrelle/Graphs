## Social Network
## What is it?

This application represents a simple social network using a graph structure. It allows users to add people (nodes) to the network and establish friendships (edges) between them. The application then displays a list of people and their respective friends.

## Features:

• Add Person: Allows you to add people to the social network.

• Add Friendship: Allows you to create mutual friendships between people.

• Display Network: Displays the list of people in the network and their friends.

## Why did I make this application:

I made this application to practice using graph structures and to learn how to model relationships, like friendships, in a social network.


## How does it contribute to the community:

• Community Contribution: The concepts applied here can be expanded for real-world applications such as modeling friendships in social media platforms, improving recommendation systems, and other scenarios that involve relationships between entities.



## How It Works:

• The program creates a social network using a graph structure where each person is a node.

• You can add people to the network using the addPerson method.

• To form friendships, the program adds edges between people using the addFriendship method, making the relationship mutual.

• The displayNetwork method shows the people in the network and their friends, printing them in the console.
